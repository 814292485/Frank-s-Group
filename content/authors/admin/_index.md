bio: |
  Prof. Frank S.C. Lee joined the Sustainable Energy and Environment Thrust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as a full professor in September 2023 and has been appointed as the Head of the Thrust of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (EOAS) since January 2025. Prior to his joining the HKUST(GZ), he worked at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a full professor.
  He earned a Doctorate in Environmental Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley in 1994. He has been working on air quality and control, specializing in the evolution characteristics of toxic and hazardous pollutants, source emission inventories, and control technologies for indoor and outdoor air pollutants. Prof. Lee established the first Laboratory of Carbon Aerosols in Asia in 2003 and has led to carry out a great number of national key research programs in chemical characteristics, sources, transportations, transformations, and environmental & health effects of urban/regional PM2.5, carbon aerosols, secondary pollutants, and toxic gaseous pollutants. He has completed the first and comprehensive emission inventory and source emission profiles of vehicles, cooking, ships, and household cleaners in Hong Kong. He has made significant contributions to research with international impact, publishing over 400 papers in leading journals such as Environmental Science & Technology, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental, and Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (based on Web of Science data as of January 2025), with over 31,000 citations and an h-index of 104 (based on Web of Science data as of January 2025).
  With his merit performance in research, he was awarded as one of the four winners (Aerosol Field) in the Special Contribution Award of the 30th anniversary of Chinese Society of Particuology in 2016. He was also awarded as Highly-Cited Researcher of Cross-field from 2018 to 2021 by Clarivate Analytic. And in 2019, he was awarded as Fellow of Asian Aerosol Research Assembly (AARA) and was appointed as Chang Jiang Scholars Visiting Chair Professor of Xi’an Jiaotong University. He ranked 8th in China and 114th globally in the field of Environmental Science in 2024 by Research.com and listed among the World's Top 2% Scientists by Stanford University from 2021 to 2024. He received the 2024 Lyman A Ripperton Environmental Educator Award for his exceptional contributions to talent cultivation in atmospheric science, indoor air quality, emission control, and exposure assessment. He is the first Chinese scientist honored with this distinction since its inception.
